# Oedatamodel release structure

We use the terms latest and future to describe a release. Latest contains the current stable release. 
Additionally there is a subfolder which shows the version number of the current release. The folder 
future contains the latest release, if there are changes that should be published in a future release 
a new version of the data model is created in the future folder. 

Releases are stored in the release history folder. A user can continue to use older versions if necessary. 

# Oedatamodel and Datapackage

We publish a datapackage for ever release. The datapackage contains a oemetadata.json file with example 
or template contend and CSV files that represent the data model.
