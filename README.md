# Open Energy Family - Datamodel
A common open energy data model (oedatamodel) and datapackage format for energy and scenario data.

# Introduction
The oedatamodel is provided as a template data model and is designed for and used by energy system modelers. The core objective of the oedatamodel is to provide a generic data structure in which data from multiple frameworks can be stored. A uniform data structure should facilitate the comparability of the different models. The oedatamodel was developed from the results of 5 energy system modeling frameworks, which include: Balomrel, oemof, genesys-mod, genesys-mod-2 and urbs. In addition existing approaches and ideas such as the [IAMC data format](https://github.com/IAMconsortium/pyam#data-model) or [Do-a-thon: Towards a common data standard 
for integrated assessment and energy systems modelling](https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/t/do-a-thon-towards-a-common-data-standard-for-integrated-assessment-and-energy-systems-modelling/1774/5) were adopted in the development process. 

## Datamodel variations 
During development, it became apparent that the usability of datamodels that are available in a form that is primarily suitable for a database is not always comprehensible to users. For this reason, there are two variations of the oedata model. 
- [Variation 1 Normalization](): Focuses on the avoidance of redundancies such as the same columns in different tables. The tables are normalized and are particularly suitable for installation on a database. The normalization variation consists of four tables: scenario, data, scalar and timeseries. The data table aggregates all fields that are equally relevant for scalar and timeseries data. The timeseries and sclar tables contain the raw data. 
- [Variation 2 Concrete](): Efforts are made to simplify handling when a user fills in data to the oedatamodel tables using file formats like .csv. The Concrete variation provides tables for scenario, scalar and timeseries data. This allows data sets to be filled in one table each for sclar or timeseries data.

## Technical documentation
The technical documentation is provided in the form of [entity relationship models]() (ERM). There the structure of the data model is shown on the basis of tables with column names, data types and key attributes, as well as the relationships between tables. This information is important to understand the structure and to install the data model on a database such as [ProstgreSQL](). 

## Datapackage
To upload finished datasets to the OEP or to share the data outside of a database we use the [frictionless datapackage]() format. A datapackage consists of a datapackage.json file that documents various metadata and the data structure. The data is stored as csv files.

## Examples
To enhance the usability of the oedatamodel examples were created. On the one hand, there are descriptions and examples for each table of the oedatamodel concrete variation, which can be found [here](), and on the other hand, [template csv]() files have been created to ease the process of data creation. 

In addition, an example of a [correctly created datapackage]() is provided, since a very precise procedure is important when creating it.

## Release content
The latest version can be found in the folder [oedatamodel/latest](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oedatamodel/tree/develop/oedatamodel/latest). Each release contains:

- ERM "OEDataModel-normalization.pdf" and "OEDataModel-concrete.pdf" 
- .er files that are used to generate the ERM .pdf files
- Datapackage with template content for "OEDataModel-concrete-datapackage" and "OEDataModel-normalization-datapackage"

# Usage
Lern about file and data conventions as well as oemedatamodel fild descriptions and table examples that help to create correct datasets.

## File conventions
To use the oedatamodel we recommend the use of [csv]() files to convert data from an individual data structure into the oedatamodel concrete format.  
To avoid further conflicts a ";" must be used as column delimiter in the csv file. The correct application is demonstrated by [templates]().

##  Data conventions
### Fields that are not present or empty

- When transferring data from your own data format to the oedatamodel, it may happen that fields cannot be filled properly. In this case we recommend not to leave the field empty but to insert the value "unkown" into the field.

### Delimiter and decimal sepperators for data series 

- If you insert timeseries data into the oedatamodel format make sure to use the delimiter "," in e.g. .csv files for delimiting a series of values. Decimal numbers are separated by a "." .

Example:
A series ist stored inside an array datatype, each value is delimited by ",".

# Next Steps: Upload data(-package) to the OEP

### Conversion of an individual data structure into oedatamodel 
To upload a dataset, several steps have to be carried out. there are different approaches. First, it is always necessary to create a datapackage from your own data. There are two possibilities to transfer the data from an individual data structure into the oedatamodel. 
1. data is entered manually into the oedatamodel concrete format and a datapackage is created from it. 
2. a datapackage is created from the individual data structure without any changes to the structure itself. Then a mapping that maps the fields of the individual data structure to the fields of the oedatamodel is created using the [oedatamodel_api]().

### Create new oedatamodel tables
Before data can be uploaded to the database, the tables for it must be created on the OEP. For this purpose, the oedatamodel normalization variation is used and the tables are given project-specific names. For example, the tables are then called "project_name_oed_scenario" etc. . This allows the oedatamodel to be used by multiple projects. For the creation of the tables on the OEP a [Guide](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/tutorial/blob/develop/upload/OEP_Upload_Process_Data_and_Metadata_oem2orm.ipynb) is offered.

### Upload a datapackage
Subsequently, the oedatamodel_api can be used for both use cases of the data transfer. Here, datapackges can be imported via a website as a zipe Datapackage folder and then uploaded to the OEP optinally with or without mapping to the tables. the datapackge is validated before the upload. For more information about the use of the oedatamodel_api and the upload see here.

# How to edit the Entity Relationship Modell

To generate an ERM as PDF we use a [erm tool](https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd). The [er or erd](https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd#the-er-file-format) file format offers a simple syntax and 
can be created and saved using a standard text editor.  

For the generation of the ERM e.g. in .pdf format the installation of the erm tool is necessary. For 
detailed instructions, please see the [package description](https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd#installation).   

After successful installation, a terminal/CMD must be opened and the console command (Windows: 'cd path')
must be used to navigate to the folder where the .er/.erd file is stored. To execute the tools, the command 
is then used in the Terminal/CMD to generate the ERM: 

`erd -i oedatamodel.er -o oedatamodel.pdf`
